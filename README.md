<b>Functionality & Concepts used</b>
  - The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps to look throughts the characters easily.
  - Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
  - Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience AutocompleteText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier to search characters.
  - RecyclerView : To present the list of different characters
  - LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the location of characters and to check if they are alive or dead.
